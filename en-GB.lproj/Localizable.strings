  Personal Best

/*
NOTES: 

'Personal Best' should never be localized, as it is a proper noun.

Idiomatic phrases that sound good in English but don't translate well shouldn't
be translated exactly, but instead to a close match. For example "Put your workouts to work"
only really makes sense in English.

The workout type descriptions at the bottom of this file should ideally match the available
workouts in watchOS's Workouts app. If you don't want to go through the Workouts app to map
strings to workout types, simply leave them blank and I will do it. No pressure!
